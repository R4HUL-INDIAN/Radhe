# Features 

𝗥𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗲 is a tool that automatically enumerates subdomains, checks if they are live, and finds "Unauth cache Purge" issues. It has different modules that can be used for different tasks.

The following are the modules available in 𝗥𝗮𝗱𝗵𝗲:

- Subdomain Enumeration: This module enumerates all the subdomains of a given domain. It uses a variety of techniques to enumerate subdomains, including DNS brute force, passive DNS, and WHOIS lookups.

- Liveness Check: This module checks if a given subdomain is live. It does this by trying to access the subdomain using a variety of methods, including HTTP, HTTPS, and Tools like Puredns, Httpx.

- Unauth Cache Purge: This module finds "Unauth cache Purge" issues. These are issues where a subdomain can be purged from a cache without authorization. This can be a security issue, as it can allow an attacker to delete sensitive data from a cache.

- SSRF Vulnerability Detection: The SSRF Vulnerability Detection module identifies potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities occur when an application allows unauthorized external requests to be made from the server-side, potentially exposing sensitive information or enabling attackers to interact with internal systems. Detecting and addressing SSRF vulnerabilities is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the application, preventing potential data leaks, and mitigating unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

Radhe is a powerful tool that can be used to find security vulnerabilities in a website. It is easy to use and can be run on any platform.
